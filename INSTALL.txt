Installation
------------
Drush archiver depends on drush (the DRUpal SHell). To use drush archiver, you
have to download and install drush first: http://drupal.org/project/drush. 
Install instructions can be found at http://tinyurl.com/install-drush. 
It contains a section about installing other commands like drush archiver.

Here is the relevant section.

You can put this folder in a number of places:

- In a .drush folder in your HOME folder. Note, that you have to make the
  .drush folder yourself (so you end up with ~/.drush/drush_make/INSTALL.txt).
- In a folder specified with the include option (see above).
- In /path/to/drush/commands (not a Smart Thing, but it would work).
